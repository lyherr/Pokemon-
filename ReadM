 In this project, we are trying to use different models to identify which variables can define the type of a Pokemon and predict whether a Pokemon is legendary or not
 For performing type classification, we used tree-based model and multinomial logistic regression
 For predicting whether a Pokemon is legendary or not, we used logistic regreesion, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, KNN model, SVM, Random Forest and AdaBoosting models.
